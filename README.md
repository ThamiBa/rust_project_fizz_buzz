# FizzBuzz in Rust

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem using the Rust programming language. The program prints the numbers from 1 to 150. For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz",If no of these statements are satisfied print out the number.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine. You can verify your installation by running:

```sh
rustc --version
```

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fizzbuzz-rust.git
cd fizzbuzz-rust
```

 **Build the Project**: Use Cargo to build the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running the Program

To execute the FizzBuzz program, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

### Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see output similar to this:

```sh
